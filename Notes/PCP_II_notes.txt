******** LECTURE 1 : Synchronization ********

*** Condition Variable ***

Problem:
Busy waiting || Spinning
Repeatedly enquiring lock to check

Solution: Condition Variable
- associated with mutex
- protect section of code with mutual exclusion

With conditional variables thread can place a lock when enetered to the critical section
After the thread exited the critial section releases the lock
Wakes other waiting thread in the waiting room

3 operations:
- wait
- signal
- broadcast

wait:
- Automatically release lock on the mutex
- Go to sleep and enter waiting queue
- Reacquire lock when woken up

signal:
- Wake up one thread from condition variable queue
- Also called 'notify' or 'wake'

broadcast:
- Wake up all threads from condition variable queue
- Also called 'notify' all or 'wake all'

Tip:
By making thread wait in a while loop we can prevent spurious wake up.
In some OSs threads can wake up when not intended to.


while !(SOME_CONDITION)
{
    cv.wait ( lk );
}


*** Producer - Consumer ***

A common design pattern in concurrent programming is
the Producer-Consumer architecture.

Producer thread(s)
- Adds elements to the shared data structure

Consumer thread(s)
- Remove elements from shared data structure

Queue (FIFO)
- first item added is the first item to be consumed

Challenges
- Consider how fast producer produces and consumer consumes

Unbound Queue
- in theory limitless space but limited by memory

Average Rate Of Production < Average Rate Of Consumption

Pipeline
- Chain of processing elements
- Series of producer and consumers are chained

*** Semaphore ***

- Synchronization mechanism to control the access to the critical section
- Can multiple threads utilize this to access to the critical
section at the same time
- Has a counter mechanism, limits the number of threads that can access

Binary semaphore is like mutex
- Mutex can be unlocked by the thread locked it
- Semaphore can be acquired/release by different threads


Producer-Consumer Semaphore
- Two semaphores: fillCount, emptyCount
- Producer:
  - Acquire emptyCount (emptyCount - 1)
  - Put item into buffer
  - Release fillCount (fillCount + 1)
- Consumer:
 - Acquire fillCount (fillCount - 1) 
  - Remove item from buffer
  - Release emptyCount (emptyCount + 1)


******** LECTURE 2 : Barriers ********

*** Race Condition ***

Data Racing - Race Condition are different terms

Data Racing : Two or more threads concurrently access the same memory location
- Solution: Mutual exclusion on the shared resource

Race Condition: Flaw in the timing on the programs execution
- Data races can cause race conditions too (not necessary)

Race conditions are sometimes type of Heisenbug.
Heisenbug: A software bug that disappears when you try to study it.
